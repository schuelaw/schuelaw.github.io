Here are a few projects I've worked on over the years as a math professor
in the [Department of Mathematics &
Statistics](https://www.whitman.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/mathematics)
at [Whitman College](https://www.whitman.edu/) in [Walla Walla, WA
USA](https://www.wallawallawa.gov/).

# Teaching Projects

## Phone Sensor Math
This is a [repository](https://github.com/schuelaw/PhoneSensorMath) of
math-oriented projects that incorporate data from sensors found in typical
cell phones. A few of these projects were developed with senior math major
[Ally Collier](https://github.com/AllyCollier).

## Mastery Vector Calculus
This [repository](https://github.com/schuelaw/MasteryVectorCalculus)
contains a description of and resources for a mastery learning vector
calculus course developed during the Fall 2020 semester in which the COVID
pandemic forced me to teach on-line.

# P5JS Projects
[P5JS](https://p5js.org/) is a javascript library that enables relatively
easy coding of web-based, interactive, visualizations. There are a lot of
other javascript frameworks that enable similar development, but few as
accessible as this one.

## Vector Field Visualization
